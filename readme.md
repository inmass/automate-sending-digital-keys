Automate Sending Digital Keys.

This plugin made to fulfill the need of automating selling digital products to help you focus on other important things.

- You can create as many product types you want (Ex: OFFICE2021PRO, WINDOWS10 ...)
- You can you can set a type to your products by going to product editing page, and look for ASDK type.
- You can add keys and assign them to one of the types you already created before.

This way once the order becomes processing or in hold, an active key the same key type as the product will be automatically sent to the buyer in their email by the ASDK system.

After each order created the ASDK system automatically checks your Microsoft office and windows keys using the PID check, If the system got a negative response it will automatically disable the key.
